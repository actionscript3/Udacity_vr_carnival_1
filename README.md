Not exactly sure what the ReadMe file format should be. 


##Problem

In the requirements it says that we should include a Build.zip. 
This is problematic for a free Git Account.

I get the Following error:

    remote: error: File build.zip is 400.94 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
