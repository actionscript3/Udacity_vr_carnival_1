## requirements

    Unity 2017.10f3

    GVR Unity SDK v1.60.0

Not exactly sure what the ReadMe file format should be. 


## Problem

In the requirements it says that we should include a Build.zip. 
This is problematic for a free Git Account.

I get the Following error:

    remote: error: File build.zip is 400.94 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB  

It would seem that one shoudl not submit compiled code to GIT, 
perhaps this requirement is in error? 

### Note

There really does not appear a way to submit our projects through github, if
folks are would really like to know how they are doing it. Seems the 100mb
is a hard limit for Github.
